# Assignment3
This is my homework submission for CISC 3130 data structures MY9 class. It should be used to create a word frequency for an inputed text file.

A type of text file this could be used for is a song, a book, a speach. Word Frequency is a list of words and the amount of times each word was used.

In order to create this frequency I used a dictionary. I used this because a dictionary with the key-value pair was suggested by my professor. The key would be the world and the value is the number of times the word appears.
This code was mostly done from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-a-hashmap-according-to-values/ and from my Professor's example. I slightly modified it.

Example of input and output:

Input: 
"Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."
